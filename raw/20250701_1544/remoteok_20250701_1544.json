With Tinybird, you can effortlessly ingest multiple data sources at scale, query and shape it using the 100% pure SQL you already know and love, and publish results as low-latency, high-concurrency APIs for your applications to chirp about. Developers can create fast APIs, fasterâwhat used to take hours and days now only takes minutes! Tinybird is the essential tool that data engineers and software developers have been waiting for enabling you to drive innovation with ease.</p>\\n<p></p><p><br></p><b>What you will be doing: We are looking for someone to help us scale and to keep our software and infrastructure reliable and elastic as we scale. Someone who knows how to make hardware and software play together, and that participate as part of the oncall team, to understand not only our product, but also the issues our clients face.</b><ul><li>âWe run our stack in Linux. We try to keep things simple. Technologies we use:</li><li>OpenResty: SSL termination and load balancing</li><li>Varnish: load balancing and, sometimes, caching</li><li>Redis: metadata store</li><li>Python: most of our backend uses Python except some small bits that rely on C++ for hot paths</li><li>ClickHouse: our main data store</li><li>Zookeeper: for ClickHouse replicas coordination</li><li>We use Grafana, Loki and Mimir for monitoring and alerting</li><li>Terraform: Cloud provisioning (virtual machines, networks, Kubernetes clusters)</li><li>Ansible: Deploys and software and config provisioning</li><li>Our number of machines is still manageable, but the number keeps growing as we keep adding customers. This is not about managing infrastructure but about making sure that our software uses the hardware resources wisely and flexibly. This means you will not only have to worry about automating machines, but about helping the product team to design and develop the architecture of the system as a whole. That will require you to work with our backend code and to understand how ClickHouse works.</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li><b>Some challenges and things we want to improve:</b></li><li>High-availability and elasticity: as we keep adding customers, we need to architect our system to be more efficient and flexible</li><li>Observability: from specific resource usage to a bird's eye view of the whole platform. This requires good knowledge of storage, networking, and computing</li><li>Disaster recovery: improving our tooling to manage and discover problems, but also improving our on-call procedures</li><li>As a specific challenge: when our customers grow, we need to upgrade their accounts. Now, we do it manuallyânot in the traditional sense of manual because we have tools that automate much of the process, but we need to take care of that one customer at a time: deciding what machines we need to spin-up, how much compute capacity we will provision, etc. Ideally, our architecture should allow our customers to upgrade themselves and assign more resources to them dynamically and seamlessly in the most dynamic, safe and transparent way possible.</li></ul><p><br></p><b>What you bring:</b><ul><li>Experience designing, building and running distributed Cloud architectures and large scale web based applications. That is, in so many words, what you will be responsible for at Tinybird</li><li>Programming skills and willingness to dive into our codebase, ClickHouse source code, or any other software we use in order to figure out how things work. At Tinybird, we work mostly with Python and C++</li><li>Accountable and enthusiastic to take on the responsibility of designing and managing the platform, and an urge to take on things that may be broken. Unafraid to break stuff because you own it and can fix it if need be.</li><li>Bias for action, iteration and delivery. Conscious that often decisions can be reversed quickly and that speed is of the essence in business and technology</li><li>That you think in terms of systems and you are attuned to edge cases, failure modes, behaviors, specific implementations</li><li>Comfortable collaborating and communicating asynchronously, but expect direct communication within the team on a daily basis</li><li>Build software with empathy, ensuring it's intuitive and maintainable.

Industry giants like Adobe and IBM trust our courses to train their teams, and prestigious universities such as MIT and the University of Cambridge use our materials in their curricula.</p><p>Weâve assembled anÂ <strong>exceptional team of unicorns</strong>Â who support, inspire, and challenge each other every day. We wake up each morning excited to build a brighter future for millions of people around the world.</p><p>But somethingâs missing. And we thinkÂ <strong>it could be you</strong>.</p><p>This is a role for someone who can âwalk the talk.â Weâre not looking for a self-proclaimed âbrand ninjaâ or âmarketing rockstar.â We want aÂ <strong>builder,Â </strong>someone who knows how to get things done, shows proof, not pitch, and lives for measurable outcomes.</p><h2><strong>Do You Share the Vision of IxDF?</strong></h2><p>People donât just buy our courses; they invest in a better version of themselves. Thatâs why every campaign and content piece we create must do more than âmarket.â It must reflect what we believe in as a brand:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Show the dream outcome:</strong>Â Help people imagine a future of creative, meaningful work, freedom, fulfillment, flexibility, and impact through great design.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strengthen belief in success:</strong>Â Build confidence through real stories, practical roadmaps, and expert-led guidance. People should feel, âIf they did it, I can too.â</p></li><li><p><strong>Speed up the time to value:</strong>Â Offer instant wins. Make progress feel close and tangible not someday, but now.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lower the effort barrier:</strong>Â Make it feel doable. No jargon. No overwhelm. Just human, beginner-friendly, bite-sized steps that meet people where they are.</p></li></ul><p>Your job would be to translate this into headlines, hooks, content pieces, social media posts, campaigns, and data-informed strategy. Youâll create clarity, motivation, and momentum with a dash of unicorn magic.</p><h2><strong>What You Will Be Doing</strong></h2><p>Youâll be at the core of our growth engine, running and optimizing the systems that bring learners into our ecosystem. You will:</p><ul><li><p>Create, own and scaleÂ <strong>organic content</strong>Â that earns attention, builds trust, and drives long-term growth across platforms.</p></li><li><p>Plan and executeÂ <strong>high-impact campaigns</strong>Â for events like Black Friday, New Year, Unicorn Day, and Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Youâll turn briefs into successful results and reports into actionable insights.</p></li><li><p>Experiment withÂ <strong>new channels</strong>Â like TikTok, Reddit, YouTube Shortsâlaunching quick pilots and scaling what works.</p></li><li><p>Build and maintain clear,Â <strong>concise documentation</strong>Â and reporting dashboards to make campaign operations more transparent, repeatable, and effective.</p></li><li><p>UseÂ <strong>analytics to learn and iterate</strong>, not just report. Your campaigns get smarter every time.</p></li><li><p>Champion our value propositionâbe aÂ <strong>brand ambassador</strong>Â for our mission, bringing our voice, vision, and values to life across every touchpoint.</p></li><li><p>Run and scaleÂ <strong>paid media</strong>Â on Meta, Google, LinkedIn, and YouTube. From targeting to copywriting to ROAS trackingâyouâll own it all.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>About you</strong></h2><p>Youâre an optimizer, a problem-solver, and a builder. More specifically:</p><ul><li><p>You bringÂ <strong>storytelling and creativity</strong>Â to your work and can craft organic content that captures attention and connects with users.</p></li><li><p>You have a sixth sense for micro-copy, and the know-how toÂ <strong>write</strong>Â <strong>persuasive, on-brand copy</strong>Â that drives action.</p></li><li><p>You haveÂ <strong>experience with</strong>Â <strong>launching</strong>Â <strong>campaigns</strong>Â across owned and paid platforms and have the track record to show it.</p></li><li><p>You areÂ <strong>comfortable with platforms</strong>Â like Meta Ads Manager, Google Ads, and LinkedIn Campaign Manager, and you understand their constraints and superpowers.</p></li><li><p>You donât just launch ads, youÂ <strong>improve everything around them</strong>: the copy, the images, the funnel, the flow, the analytics.</p></li><li><p>Youâre driven byÂ <strong>impact and fluent in data</strong>Â - you use metrics to uncover insights, guide decisions, and optimize performance. But you also understand human behavior, platform psychology, and what makes a message truly land.</p></li><li><p>You view AI not as a threat or a substitution for that infamous human touch but as aÂ <strong>force multiplier of your human capabilities</strong>. You use AI to build faster, smarter, and better results.</p></li><li><p>You have aÂ <strong>keen eye for content</strong>, and you can quickly understand what type of content is meaningful, appropriate and useful in each situation or each platform.</p></li><li><p>You areÂ <strong>fluent in written English</strong>Â with exceptional writing skills, grammar and an appreciation for the power of tone, brevity and microscopy.</p></li><li><p>You areÂ <strong>based within the UTC -1 to UTC +3 time zone,</strong>Â which is crucial to ensure optimal collaboration and overlapping working hours.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Bonus points</strong></h2><p>You stand out if you...</p><ul><li><p>Have experience creating or managingÂ <strong>video-centric campaigns</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Know your way aroundÂ <strong>GA4, GTM, and server-side tagging</strong>.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>What We Can Offer</strong></h2><ul><li><p>AÂ <strong>full-time position</strong>, within a fully remote organization.

The rapid growth of AI is worsening this problem, as the purview of the modern manager expands.
